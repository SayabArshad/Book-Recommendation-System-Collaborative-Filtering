🚀 The **Book Recommendation System** is a lightweight Python application that implements **user-based collaborative filtering** to recommend books. By analyzing user ratings and computing **cosine similarity** between users, the system suggests new books that similar users have enjoyed but the target user hasn't read yet. It's a perfect starting point for understanding recommendation engines and similarity metrics.

## 💡 About the Project

This project demonstrates the core idea behind collaborative filtering – a technique widely used in modern recommendation systems (like Netflix or Amazon). It builds a user-item matrix from rating data, computes user similarities, and generates personalized recommendations. The simple implementation makes it ideal for learning and experimentation.
